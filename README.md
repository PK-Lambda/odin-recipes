# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin Project. The name of this project is Recipes. 
The purpose of this project is to build HTML-only recipes website
through the application of my knowledge I've acquired over the last
month studing git and HTML foundations.

According to the instructions, the website will consist of a main
index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website is
meant to look very basic because the purpose of this project is
just to build my HTML chops. This project will be revisited in the
future to style it up with CSS.
